    <title>Use of processing instructions</title>

    <para>
      Note that it is possible to evaluate expressions inline, using
      the <tag>eval</tag> processing instruction: '<?eval ${example.title}?>'
      and '<?eval ${2 * 34 / 3}?>' or '<?eval ${foo}?>'. Processing instructions
      can only be used inside xml elements and cannot be used in xml attributes.

    <title>Use of entity substitutions</title>
    
    <para>
      This sample shows the use of entity substitution defined in your
      pom.xml configuration: &amp;version; = &version;. The entity substitution is
      also working within xml attributes as you can see in the following link:
      <link xlink:href="http://&version;">this is a link</link>.

    </para>
    <para>Another type of entity is the one defined in a dedicated file named
    <filename>docbkx.<replaceable>type</replaceable>.ent</filename>. These
    files must me located on same directory as your xml input file. Here
    is an example with &amp;type; = &type;</para>

    <para>For both of these entities format, you must define the Docbook DTD DOCTYPE
    even if you are using docbook 5 and XSL schema otherwise it will not work.
    This feature relies on an old feature of the plugin but sometimes it can help, so
    check the logs</para>
